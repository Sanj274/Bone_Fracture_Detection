# Bone_Fracture_Detection
A cost-effective fracture detection system using  sound waves and FFT analysis in MATLAB

The proposed device leverages the computational capabilities of MATLAB to provide a 
portable and efficient means of fracture detection. By harnessing sound waves, which are 
safer than ionizing radiation, the device minimizes potential health risks for patients and 
healthcare professionals. Furthermore, the use of FFT analysis enables real-time processing 
of sound wave signals, allowing for rapid and accurate identification of fractures. This 
approach holds significant promise for enhancing fracture diagnosis, particularly in resource
limited settings where access to traditional imaging modalities may be limited.
